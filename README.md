# emotion_sound
 sound generated by facial expressions
 In this project, I wanted to detect human's face and make some sounds due to the emotions, I used clmtrackr to get the value of six emotions, happy, angry, disgused, surprised, fear and sad. Sometimes the emotion predictions were not accurate, but by multiplying them and calculate them to the pitches of notes, it could control sounds. Also, I added some beats effect and extra notes than the main loop recording to major or minor in music to enrich the melody. 
 To generate sounds, I mainly used sampler and transport functions in Tone.js.
